# DnD 5e Adventure Miniature Lists

A collection of lists of miniatures to run the D&D Adventures Modules

## Modules (more to come later)

- Lost Mine of Phandelver
- Curse of Strahd (Work in Progress)

## How to Use

For each Adventure Module there will be a 'miniature' list and a 'raw' list.

The 'miniature' list is the minimum quantities of each character/creature to be covered for any possible encounter in the book.

The 'raw' list is my takeoffs from the book, and includes page numbers and additional visual descriptions that may affect the miniatures you choose and how you paint them.

If you want separate miniatures for the red hat Goblin clan encounter and the green hat Goblin clan encounter, use the 'raw' list. If you're happy to use a generic Goblin for both, use the 'miniatures' list.
